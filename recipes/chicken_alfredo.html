        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken Alfredo is a creamy, indulgent Italian pasta dish made with tender, pan-seared chicken breast and a rich, velvety Alfredo sauce. 
        The sauce is made by simmering heavy cream, butter, and garlic together, then mixing in freshly grated Parmesan cheese to create a smooth, cheesy texture.
        The chicken is seasoned with salt and pepper, cooked until golden brown, and sliced into strips. The sauce is then combined with cooked fettuccine pasta, and the sliced chicken is added on top.
        The result is a comforting, flavorful dish with a perfect balance of savory chicken and creamy, cheesy sauce, often garnished with parsley for a touch of color.</p>

        <h2>Steps to make Chicken Alfredo:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the Pasta:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine pasta and cook according to the package instructions, usually about 8-10 minutes, until al dente.</li>
                <li>Drain the pasta, reserving about 1/2 cup of pasta water, and set it aside.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Cook the Chicken:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>While the pasta is cooking, season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
                <li>Heat 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
                    Add the chicken breasts and cook for about 6-7 minutes per side, until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through (internal temperature should reach 165°F or 75°C).</li>
                <li>Remove the chicken from the skillet and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing it into thin strips.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Make the Alfredo Sauce:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Pour in the heavy cream and bring to a simmer, stirring frequently. Allow the cream to cook for about 3-4 minutes, until it thickens slightly.</li>
                <li>tir in the grated Parmesan cheese, and continue to stir until the cheese has melted and the sauce becomes smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Combine the Pasta and Sauce:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the Alfredo sauce. 
                Toss the pasta in the sauce, adding a little reserved pasta water if necessary to achieve a smooth, creamy consistency.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Serve:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Plate the pasta and top with the sliced chicken.</li>
