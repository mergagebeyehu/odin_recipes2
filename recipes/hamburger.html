        <h2>Steps to make a Hamburger</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Patties</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions (for 4 burgers). Gently shape each portion into a round patty, about 3/4 inch thick.
                    Use your thumb to make a small indentation in the center of each patty to help it cook evenly.</li>
                    <li>Season both sides with salt and black pepper.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Cook the Patties</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat a grill or a skillet over medium-high heat. If using a skillet, add a small amount of oil to prevent sticking.</li>
                    <li>Cook the patties for about 3-4 minutes per side for medium doneness (longer if you prefer your burger more well-done). If adding cheese,
                    place a slice of cheese on the patty during the last minute of cooking to melt.</li>
                
                </ul>
            <li>Toast the buns</li>
            <ul>
                <li>While the patties are cooking, slice the hamburger buns in half.
                    Toast the buns on the grill or in a separate skillet for about 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Assemble the Burger</li>
            <ul>Place the cooked patty on the bottom half of each bun.
                Add your preferred toppings (lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, etc.), then place the top half of the bun on top.</ul>
            <li>Serve</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Serve your homemade hamburger with sides like fries or a salad, and enjoy!</li> 
            </ul>
        </ol>
