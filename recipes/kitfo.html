        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kitfo is a traditional Ethiopian dish made from finely minced raw beef, 
        seasoned with a mixture of spices, and often served with injera, a type of sourdough flatbread. The beef is usually minced to a paste-like consistency and mixed with mitmita,
        a spicy blend of ground chili peppers, cardamom, and other spices. It's also commonly flavored with niter kibbeh, a clarified butter infused with herbs and spices like garlic, 
        ginger, and turmeric. While some versions of kitfo are served raw, others are lightly cooked by gently saut√©ing the mixture, making it a versatile dish. Kitfo is often accompanied 
        by gomen (steamed greens) or chechebsa (a spiced flatbread), and is considered a dish that highlights the deep flavors and aromatic spices of Ethiopian cuisine.</p>
