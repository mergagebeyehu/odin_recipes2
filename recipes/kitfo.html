        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kitfo is a traditional Ethiopian dish made from finely minced raw beef, 
        seasoned with a mixture of spices, and often served with injera, a type of sourdough flatbread. The beef is usually minced to a paste-like consistency and mixed with mitmita,
        a spicy blend of ground chili peppers, cardamom, and other spices. It's also commonly flavored with niter kibbeh, a clarified butter infused with herbs and spices like garlic, 
        ginger, and turmeric. While some versions of kitfo are served raw, others are lightly cooked by gently sautéing the mixture, making it a versatile dish. Kitfo is often accompanied 
        by gomen (steamed greens) or chechebsa (a spiced flatbread), and is considered a dish that highlights the deep flavors and aromatic spices of Ethiopian cuisine.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients for Kitfo</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb Lean Beef</li>
            <li>3-4 Teaspoons Niter Kibbeh</li>
            <li>1-2 Teaspoons Mitmita</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon Berbere (optional for more spice)</li>
            <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps to make Kitfo:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Niter Kibbeh:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you don't have niter kibbeh, you can make it by melting unsalted butter and infusing it with spices like garlic, ginger,
                    turmeric, and cumin. Heat the butter on low,
                    allowing the spices to cook for about 10-15 minutes, then strain the solids out.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Prepare the Beef:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If using raw beef, ensure it is fresh and free from any excess fat.
                    Finely mince the beef using a sharp knife or pulse it in a food processor until it reaches a paste-like consistency.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Season the Beef:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the minced beef with niter kibbeh, mitmita, berbere (optional),
                    and salt. Mix well to ensure that the seasoning evenly coats the meat.
                    The amount of mitmita can be adjusted based on how spicy you like the dish.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Cook the Kitfo (optional):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Some people prefer to serve kitfo raw, but if you want to cook it slightly, heat a small amount of niter kibbeh in a skillet over low heat.
                    Add the seasoned meat and sauté it for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly to avoid overcooking. The goal is to warm the meat through, not fully cook it.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Serve with injera!</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Serve the kitfo immediately on a large platter. It is often accompanied by injera, which is used to scoop up the kitfo,
                    and optional sides like gomen (steamed greens) or chechebsa (spiced flatbread).</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
